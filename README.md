Regression and Model Evaluation

This project focuses on regression techniques in supervised machine learning.

Uses the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn.

Includes data loading, preprocessing, feature scaling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Implements multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Models are evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R-squared (R²) score

Applies cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.

Compares all models and selects the best-performing regression model based on evaluation metrics.
